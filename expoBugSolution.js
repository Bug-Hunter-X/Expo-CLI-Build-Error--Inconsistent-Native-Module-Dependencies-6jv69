The solution primarily involves thorough dependency management and careful examination of native module configurations. Here's an outline:

1. **Review Package.json:** Carefully check your `package.json` file for inconsistencies. Are native module dependencies specified correctly and are they compatible with your Expo SDK version?
2. **Check Package-Lock.json:** Examine your `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`) file to ensure that the exact versions of all dependencies (including transitive dependencies) are consistent.
3. **Clean Build:** Execute a clean build before each attempt to deploy. This will remove potential conflicts due to cached build artifacts.
    ```bash
expo prebuild --clean
```
4. **Native Module Configuration (if applicable):**  If integrating custom native modules, verify their configurations in the respective Android and iOS projects. Make sure that native dependencies are correctly linked and that there are no version conflicts.
5. **Debugging with Logs:**  If the problem persists, add extensive debugging logs to your native module build scripts to trace the execution flow and identify the specific point of failure.
6. **Isolate the Issue:**  If possible, create a small, minimal example to isolate the issue and demonstrate it independently of your main project. This helps to debug more efficiently.  
7. **Expo SDK Version:** Ensure the expo SDK version is compatible with the native modules utilized.
