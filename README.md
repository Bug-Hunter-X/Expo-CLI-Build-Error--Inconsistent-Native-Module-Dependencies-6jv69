# Expo CLI Build Error: Inconsistent Native Module Dependencies

This repository demonstrates a common, yet elusive, bug encountered when building Expo apps involving native modules. The problem arises from inconsistencies between the native modules required by your app and those present in your development environment. This often manifests as cryptic error messages during the build process, making diagnosis difficult.

## Reproducing the Issue

The `expoBug.js` file showcases a simplified scenario where a mismatch in native module dependencies could occur (the specific problematic modules are placeholder comments, as the exact nature of the problem is highly dependent on the project).

## Solution

The `expoBugSolution.js` file illustrates solutions for resolving the issue.  It emphasizes the importance of:

* **Careful Dependency Management:**  Using a precise and consistent version of all dependencies, including native modules, is crucial.  This often involves reviewing your `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files and using tools like `npm-check-updates` to identify potential version conflicts.
* **Clean Build:** Running a clean build (`expo prebuild --clean` or equivalent) can sometimes resolve discrepancies between cached files and the current state of dependencies.
* **Native Module Configuration:** If directly using native modules, meticulously verifying their configuration and dependencies within both your Expo project and native iOS/Android project is essential.
* **Debugging with Logs:** Add extensive logging to track the build steps and pinpoint where the issue occurs in the native module build pipeline.
* **Isolation:** Create a minimal reproducible example to isolate the problem from other potential dependencies.

By carefully following these steps, you can improve your chances of locating and resolving the root cause of the build failure.  Please note that the specific solution will heavily depend on the specifics of your project and the problematic native modules.
