This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the native modules required by your Expo app and the ones available in your development environment.  It might manifest as seemingly random crashes or build failures, especially if you're using custom native modules or integrating third-party libraries that have native dependencies.  Often, the error messages themselves aren't very informative, making debugging challenging.
